	default y
	help
	  If you disable this option then the kernel will only support
	  standard PC platforms. (which covers the vast majority of
	  systems out there.)

	  If you enable this option then you'll be able to select support
	  for the following non-PC x86 platforms, depending on the value of
	  CONFIG_64BIT.

	  32-bit platforms (CONFIG_64BIT=n):
		Intel CE4100
		Intel Quark
		AMD Geode
		AMD Elan
		RDC R-321x

	  64-bit platforms (CONFIG_64BIT=y):
		Numascale NumaChip
		ScaleMP vSMP
		SGI Ultraviolet
		Merrifield/Moorefield MID devices
		Goldfish (Android emulator)

	  If you have one of these systems, or if you want to build a
	  generic distribution kernel, say Y here - otherwise say N.

	  Adds support for Numascale NumaChip large-SMP systems. Needed to
	  enable more than ~168 cores.

	  Support for ScaleMP vSMP systems.  Say 'Y' here if this kernel is
	  supposed to run on these EM64T-based machines.  Only choose this option
	  if you have one of these machines.

	  Select to build a kernel capable of supporting 64-bit Intel MID
	  (Mobile Internet Device) platform systems which do not have
	  the PCI legacy interfaces.

	  The only supported devices are the 22nm Merrified (Z34xx)
	  and Moorefield (Z35xx) SoC used in the Intel Edison board and
	  a small number of Android devices such as the Asus Zenfone 2,
	  Asus FonePad 8 and Dell Venue 7.

	  If you are building for a PC class system or non-MID tablet
	  SoCs like Bay Trail (Z36xx/Z37xx), say N here.

	  Intel MID platforms are based on an Intel processor and chipset which
	  consume less power than most of the x86 derivatives.

config X86_GOLDFISH

config SCx200
	tristate "NatSemi SCx200 support"
	help
	  This provides basic support for National Semiconductor's
	  (now AMD's) Geode processors.  The driver probes for the
	  PCI-IDs of several on-chip devices, so its a good dependency
	  for other scx200_* drivers.

	  If compiled as a module, the driver is named scx200.

config SCx200HR_TIMER
	tristate "NatSemi SCx200 27MHz High-Resolution Timer Support"
	depends on SCx200
	default y
	help
	  This driver provides a clocksource built upon the on-chip
	  27MHz high-resolution timer.  Its also a workaround for
	  NSC Geode SC-1100's buggy TSC, which loses time when the
	  processor goes idle (as is done by the scheduler).  The
	  other workaround is idle=poll boot option.

config OLPC

	depends on !X86_PAE
	select GPIOLIB

config OLPC_XO1_PM
	bool "OLPC XO-1 Power Management"
	depends on OLPC && MFD_CS5535=y && PM_SLEEP

	  Add support for poweroff and suspend of the OLPC XO-1 laptop.

config OLPC_XO1_RTC
	bool "OLPC XO-1 Real Time Clock"
	depends on OLPC_XO1_PM && RTC_DRV_CMOS
	help
	  Add support for the XO-1 real time clock, which can be used as a
	  programmable wakeup source.

	bool "OLPC XO-1 SCI extras"
	depends on OLPC && OLPC_XO1_PM && GPIO_CS5535=y

config GEODE_COMMON
	bool

config ALIX
	bool "PCEngines ALIX System Support (LED setup)"
	select GPIOLIB
	select GEODE_COMMON
	help
	  This option enables system support for the PCEngines ALIX.
	  At present this just sets up LEDs for GPIO control on
	  ALIX2/3/6 boards.  However, other system specific setup should
	  get added here.

	  Note: You must still enable the drivers for GPIO and LED support
	  (GPIO_CS5535 & LEDS_GPIO) to actually use the LEDs

	  Note: You have to set alix.force=1 for boards with Award BIOS.

config NET5501
	bool "Soekris Engineering net5501 System Support (LEDS, GPIO, etc)"
	select GPIOLIB
	select GEODE_COMMON
	help
	  This option enables system support for the Soekris Engineering net5501.

config GEOS
	bool "Traverse Technologies GEOS System Support (LEDS, GPIO, etc)"
	select GPIOLIB
	select GEODE_COMMON
	depends on DMI

	select X86_REBOOTFIXUPS
	help
	  This option is needed for RDC R-321x system-on-chip, also known
	  as R-8610-(G).
	  If you don't have one of these chips, you should say N here.

config X86_REBOOTFIXUPS
	bool "Enable X86 board specific fixups for reboot"
	depends on X86_32
	help
	  This enables chipset and/or board specific fixups to be done
	  in order to get reboot to work correctly. This is only needed on
	  some combinations of hardware and BIOS. The symptom, for which
	  this config is intended, is when reboot ends with a stalled/hung
	  system.

	  Currently, the only fixup is for the Geode machines using
	  CS5530A and CS5536 chipsets and the RDC R-321x SoC.

	  Say Y if you want to enable the fixup. Currently, it's safe to
	  enable this option even if you don't need it.
	  Say N otherwise.

config TOSHIBA
	tristate "Toshiba Laptop support"
	depends on X86_32
	help
	  This adds a driver to safely access the System Management Mode of
	  the CPU on Toshiba portables with a genuine Toshiba BIOS. It does
	  not work on models with a Phoenix BIOS. The System Management Mode
	  is used to set the BIOS and power saving options on Toshiba portables.

	  For information on utilities to make use of this driver see the
	  Toshiba Linux utilities web site at:
	  <http://www.buzzard.org.uk/toshiba/>.

	  Say Y if you intend to run this kernel on a Toshiba portable.
	  Say N otherwise.

config X86_32_IRIS
	tristate "Eurobraille/Iris poweroff module"
	depends on X86_32
	help
	  The Iris machines from EuroBraille do not have APM or ACPI support
	  to shut themselves down properly.  A special I/O sequence is
	  needed to do so, which is what this module does at
	  kernel shutdown.

	  This is only for Iris machines from EuroBraille.

	  If unused, say N.

config X86_INTEL_LPSS
	bool "Intel Low Power Subsystem Support"
	depends on X86 && ACPI && PCI
	select COMMON_CLK
	select PINCTRL
	select IOSF_MBI
	help
	  Select to build support for Intel Low Power Subsystem such as
	  found on Intel Lynxpoint PCH. Selecting this option enables
	  things like clock tree (common clock framework) and pincontrol
	  which are needed by the LPSS peripheral drivers.

config X86_AMD_PLATFORM_DEVICE
	bool "AMD ACPI2Platform devices support"
	depends on ACPI
	select COMMON_CLK
	select PINCTRL
	help
	  Select to interpret AMD specific ACPI device to platform device
	  such as I2C, UART, GPIO found on AMD Carrizo and later chipsets.
	  I2C and UART depend on COMMON_CLK to set clock. GPIO driver is
	  implemented under PINCTRL subsystem.

config IOSF_MBI
	tristate "Intel SoC IOSF Sideband support for SoC platforms"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  This option enables sideband register access support for Intel SoC
	  platforms. On these platforms the IOSF sideband is used in lieu of
	  MSR's for some register accesses, mostly but not limited to thermal
	  and power. Drivers may query the availability of this device to
	  determine if they need the sideband in order to work on these
	  platforms. The sideband is available on the following SoC products.
	  This list is not meant to be exclusive.
	   - BayTrail
	   - Braswell
	   - Quark

	  You should say Y if you are running a kernel on one of these SoC's.

config IOSF_MBI_DEBUG
	bool "Enable IOSF sideband access through debugfs"
	depends on IOSF_MBI && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Select this option to expose the IOSF sideband access registers (MCR,
	  MDR, MCRX) through debugfs to write and read register information from
	  different units on the SoC. This is most useful for obtaining device
	  state information for debug and analysis. As this is a general access
	  mechanism, users of this option would have specific knowledge of the
	  device they want to access.

	  If you don't require the option or are in doubt, say N.
